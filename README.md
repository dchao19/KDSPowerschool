This chrome extension allows Kent Denver students to calculate the percentage of their grades in powerschool. There is also additional functionality that supports classes that have weighted grades (by selecting the check box "Weighted by category." Students are also able to adjust "Earned Points" value and "Total Points" value locally for purposes such as seeing what it would take to raise one's grade. Additionally, we have added a feature that allows students to see their current semester GPA. Other features coming soon...

**We are currently in 3 cities across the nation:** Denver, Colorado; Princeton, New Jersey and Spokane, Washington.

**We would love to expand to other schools using Powerschool! Please contact us at the email below for more information if interested. **

Email sgupta17@kentdenver.org with any questions, concerns or ideas for future versions. Thanks!
